# Comparison-of-Different-Searching-Algorithms
#DAA-CSE-5311 
#Programming Project



******PROJECT DESCRIPTION*******
Implement and compare the following search algorithm:
● Linear search
● Binary search in the sorted array.
● Binary search tree
● Red-Black Tree


These algorithms take an input size from the user, an element to be searched in the array, and provide the result of its presence in the array. 
It also calculates the run time required for the algorithm to search the element. 
A comparative study can also be done to compare the time complexity for each algorithm.

********Module required to run the code************
import tkinter as tk
import time
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

#PROGRAMMING LANGAUGE- Python

**********Detailed Instructions to Execute Search algorithm source code***********

1). Install Python: Download and install it from the official Python website (https://www.python.org/downloads/)

2). Unzip the files and open search.py

3). Navigate to the directory: Use the cd command to navigate to the directory where the Python code file is located.

4). Run the code: Type python search.py in the command prompt and press Enter. The code will start running. 


**********Execute the Compare Source code************

1). Open Compare.py
2). Navigate to the directory.
3). Run the Compare.py then graph will be plotted.
4). We can also use visual studio for run the source code.
